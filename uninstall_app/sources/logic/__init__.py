# Logic
The logic folder contains files with fuctions and classes used in the
others parts of the project.

## Files
This folder contains *manager* files:
- `text_manager.py` manages labels showed on UI and their translate
by json files.
- `logs_manager.py` formats and saves logs in the logs folder, counts
files in the logs folder and deletes old ones.
- `resource_path` is useful for converting the project into an
executable (.exe).
